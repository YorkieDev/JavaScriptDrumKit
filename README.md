# JavaScript Drum Kit

This project is a fun, interactive JavaScript Drum Kit, created as part of Challenge 1 of Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. It's a simple web application that plays drum sounds when the corresponding keys are pressed.

## Project Overview

The JavaScript Drum Kit allows users to play different drum sounds using their keyboard. Each key is mapped to a specific drum sound, creating an interactive drumming experience.

## Features

- Interactive keys that trigger different drum sounds.
- Visual feedback when keys are pressed.
- Sounds include clap, hihat, kick, openhat, boom, ride, snare, tom, and tink.
- Responsive design with a stylish background.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup and Usage

To use this drum kit:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Press the corresponding keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) to play the drum sounds.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the project.
- `sounds/`: A directory containing all the drum sound files (WAV format).
